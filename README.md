# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Teerex Store

Teerex Store is a simple e-commerce web application developed using React.js. It provides users with a platform to browse, search, and purchase products from a catalog. The application offers various features such as product filtering, search functionality, and shopping cart management.

## Features

- **Header:** Includes a search bar for searching products and provides a shopping cart icon to view and manage the shopping cart.
- **Filters:** Allows users to filter products based on attributes such as gender, color, price range, and type. Supports multiple filter selections for refining search results.
- **Search:** Enables users to search for products using free text input. Matches search queries against product names, colors, and types.
- **Product Cards:** Displays individual product details in a responsive grid layout. Each product card includes an image, name, and price.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add products to the shopping cart, view and manage items in the cart, increase the quantity, or remove items from the cart. Calculates and displays the total amount of items in the cart.

## Project Structure

- **Components:** Contains reusable React components for building the user interface.
- **Features:** Manages specific functionalities of the application.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
